```

## Features

* PrettierJS
* React Router v4
* React v16.x
* Redux

* Styled Components
* Webpack 4

## Submodules

This project relies on other modules in order to run. I decided to decouple some of the elements since it can be used in other projects if needed.

* [Atomic-Styles](https://github.com/abarcenas29/atomic_classes) - For general styling and my built-in css classes for creating websites
* [Webpack Config](https://github.com/abarcenas29/sandbox-webpack) - Webpack configuration of the sandbox. It can also be used on other projects when needed.
